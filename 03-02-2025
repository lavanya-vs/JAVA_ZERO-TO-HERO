Day 8 of My Java Learning Journey

- Learned Why Java is Platform-Independent in Detail:  
  -> Understood how Java achieves platform independence using the JVM.  
  -> Saw how bytecode runs on different operating systems without modification.  

- Saw Demonstration of This Using Windows and iOS:
  -> Observed how the same Java program runs on both Windows and iOS.  
  -> Understood the role of JVM in handling platform differences.  

- Understood Complete Architecture of JVM:
  -> Studied how JVM is structured and how it executes Java programs.  
  -> Learned about its key components and their functions.  

- JVM is Divided into Three Parts: Memory Area, Stack, and Heap:
  -> Explored the importance and role of each part in Java execution.  
  -> Understood how data is stored and managed in JVM.  

- Memory Area – Where `.class` Files Load Using Class Loader: 
  -> Learned how JVM loads `.class` files into memory for execution.  
  -> Studied the role of the class loader in linking and initialization.  

- Execution Engine – Uses Interpreter, JIT, and Garbage Collector: 
  -> Understood how Java code is executed step by step.  
  -> Saw how the **interpreter** runs bytecode and how **JIT** optimizes execution.  
  -> Explored how the **Garbage Collector** automatically manages memory.
