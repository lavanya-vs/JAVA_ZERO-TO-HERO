Day 11 of My Java Learning Journey

1. Java Stdin and Stdout I**  
  → Practiced reading input using `Scanner`.  
  → Used `nextInt()`, `nextDouble()`, and `next()` for different data types.  

2. Java If-Else
  → Implemented conditional logic using `if-else` statements.  
  → Checked conditions on integers and printed different outputs accordingly.  

3. Java Stdin and Stdout II
  → Explored reading multiple inputs in a single execution.  
  → Learned how `nextLine()` works after `nextInt()`.  

4.Java Output Formatting 
  → Used `System.out.printf()` for formatted output.  
  → Left-justified strings and padded integers with leading zeros.  

5. Java Loops I  
  → Used loops to print multiplication tables.  
  → Practiced `for` loops and formatted output for readability.
