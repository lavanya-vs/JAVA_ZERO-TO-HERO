 Day 1 of my Java learning journey
-> Learned about Java's origin, creator, and its definition.  
-> Explored the roles of JVM,JRE and JDK understanding their meanings and significance.  
-> Discovered how Java is *platform-independent* due to its use of bytecode, making it versatile across different platforms.
