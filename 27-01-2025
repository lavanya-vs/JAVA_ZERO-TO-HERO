 **Day 1 of my Java learning journey**  
-> Learned about **Java's origin**, creator, and its definition.  
-> Explored the **roles of JVM, JDK, and JRE**, understanding their meanings and significance.  
-> Discovered how Java is **platform-independent** due to its use of **bytecode**, making it versatile across different platforms.
