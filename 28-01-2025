 Day 2 of my Java Learning Journey  
-Learned about Data Types:  
  -> Explored primitive and non-primitive data types.  
  -> Studied in detail the size of each primitive type.  
  -> Got an overview of non-primitive types (yet to dive deeper).  
  -> Learned that heap memory and reference variables are used for non-primitive types.

- Learned about Variables: 
  -> How to declare and initialize variables.  
  -> The rules for naming variables.  

- Code Practice: 
  -> Swapping two numbers using a temporary variable.
