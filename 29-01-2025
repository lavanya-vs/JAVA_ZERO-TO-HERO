Day 3 of My Java Learning Journey  
- Learned about Literals:  
  -> Explored literal types like `int`, `char`, `boolean`, `String`.  
  -> Studied examples of each literal type and their example.  
     
- Learned about Wrapper Classes:  
  -> Understood the need for wrapper classes to convert primitives to objects.
  -> Familiarized oneself to write wrapper class to corresponding primitive class.
  -> Explored where wrapper classes are used, like in collections,serialization and autoboxing/unboxing.

- Learned about Autoboxing and Unboxing:  
  -> Autoboxing: Converting primitive to object automatically.  
    - with pseudo code  
  -> Unboxing: Converting object to primitive automatically.  
    - with pseudo code  
   -> understood how autoboxing/unboxing AND wrapper classes are linked.
